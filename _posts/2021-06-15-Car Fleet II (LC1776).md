1. Experience:
    1. I made the correct conclusion that the collision of a car has only to do with all the cars on its right hand side. Basically, we compute the time of current car to all the cars on its right, and pick the car with the least time to collide as the final collision for current car.
    2. However, this is `O(n^2)` algorithm, I was struggling to figure out how to make this `O(n)`. 
    3. I didn't think about using stack at all, also, even after hint for stack, I am not sure how I should maintain the stack, which car to remove from stack. Basically, I know I need to get the car with minimum collision time to current car, but I wasn't sure where to get this information from for the current car. It's actually right there in the results that I have been populating from right to left. 


2. How did I or Other people get the solution? 

3. Different solutions

4. Mistakes


5. Problem Type


  
6. Similar Problems

7. Template

8. I understand the solution, but HOW do I think to GET there myself?
    1. Where could you improve?
    2. What questions should I ask myself so that I push myself closer to the solution? 
    3. What conclusions did I reach that I dropped some idea for the other?
    4. How can I reach this conclusion faster ?
