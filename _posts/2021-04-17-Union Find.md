1. Traversal:
    1. Depth-First-Search (DFS)
        1. preorder
        2. inorder
        3. postorder
    2. Breadth-First-Search (BFS)
        1. preorder
        2. inorder
        3. postorder


2. How did I or Other people get the solution? 

3. Different solutions


4. Mistakes

5. Problem Type
    
6. Similar Problems

7. Template

8. I understand the solution, but HOW do I think to GET there myself?
    1. Where could you improve?
        * I should've written the DFS cleaner. This might be a candidate for template.
    2. What questions should I ask myself so that I push myself closer to the solution? 
    3. What conclusions did I reach that I dropped some idea for the other?
        * For dynamic programming, I need find sub-optimal problems. But this doesn't work here.
    4. How can I reach this conclusion faster ?
