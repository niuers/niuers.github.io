1. Greedy problems usually look like "Find minimum number of something to do something" or "Find maximum number of something to fit in some conditions", and typically propose an unsorted input.
2. The idea of greedy algorithm is to pick the locally optimal move at each step, that will lead to the globally optimal solution.
3. If you use brute force (e.g. backtrack), the time complexity will be too large. The minimum/maximum is a hint, if dynamic programming doesn't work here, so greedy might be the way to go.
3. How to prove that the greedy algorithm is correct?
   * Usually you could use the proof by contradiction.
