1. Trie:
    1. Basically Trie is a n-aray tree, where each node represents a character in a prefix.

2. Trie versus balanced tree and hash table
    1. Although hash table has O(1)O(1) time complexity for looking for a key, it is not efficient in the following operations: 
        * Finding all keys with a common prefix.
        * Enumerating a dataset of strings in lexicographical order.
    2. As hash table increases in size, there are lots of hash collisions and the search time complexity could deteriorate to `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of keys inserted. Trie could use less space compared to Hash Table when storing many keys with the same prefix. In this case using trie has only `O(m)` time complexity, where `m` is the key length. 
    3. Searching for a key in a balanced tree costs `O(mlogn)` time complexity.


3. Template
```
class Node:
    def __init__(self):
        self.link = {}
        self.is_word = False
        
class Trie:

    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initialize your data structure here.
        """
        self.root = Node()

    def insert(self, word: str) -> None:
        """
        Inserts a word into the trie.
        """
        current = self.root        
        for w in word:
            if w not in current.link:
                current.link[w] = Node()
            current = current.link[w]
            
        current.is_word = True

    def search_prefix(self, prefix):
        current = self.root
        for w in prefix:
            if w not in current.link:
                return None
            current = current.link[w]
        return current
        
    def search(self, word: str) -> bool:
        """
        Returns if the word is in the trie.
        """
        node = self.search_prefix(word)
        return node and node.is_word

    def startsWith(self, prefix: str) -> bool:
        """
        Returns if there is any word in the trie that starts with the given prefix.
        """
        node = self.search_prefix(prefix)
        return node is not None
        
```
