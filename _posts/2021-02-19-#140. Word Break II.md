1. Experience:
    1. I first solved the problem 139. Word Break using recursive method plus memoization. It's pretty straightforward.
    2. Here, I modified the solution to change the return of the recursive function to a list of strings. And it works ok.
    3. By reading the solution, notice that we can also use `@lru_cache` for memoization.

2. How did I or Other people get the solution? 


3. Different solutions
    1. Apparently, this is a dynamic programming problem.
    2. Recursive+memoization solution is normally a top-down dynamic, while iterative solution is bottom-up dynamic programming. 
    3. The top-down approach can also be considered as `backtracking` or `DFS` traversal over a tree
    4. The bottom-up approach can also be considered as `BFS` traversal over a tree.



4. Mistakes
    1. It's not so easy to get the time complexity of the algorithm with and without memoization. 
    2. Note for the posfix tree, we need visit each edge once and only once.
