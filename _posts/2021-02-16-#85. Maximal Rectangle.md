1. Experience:
    1. I first wrote a brutal force solution, where I check each point in the matrix, and start from that point, what's the maximum area I can achieve. Since each time, I have to goto as far right as I can and goto as far bottom as I can, it takes `O(mn)`. (I keep a record of current minimal right-most position). So the total time complexity is `O(m^2n^2)`. 
    2. Later, I moved the computation of right-most/bottom-most limits for each point out of the loop, so I compute them first in `O(mn)` time complexity. Then I check each point using them, inside the loop, I only have to go through the maximum number of rows for each point, so the time complexity is `O(m^2n) + O(mn)=O(m^2n)`.


2. How did I get the solution? 
    1. I think it's worthwhile to start with brutal force. I didn't expect it to pass the tests. Thought I would get a TLE, but I didn't.

3. Different solutions
    1. This can be solved using the solution for `histogram` as in problem 84. Just treat each row and the points above as a histgram, and apply the solution. This will result `O(mn)` time complexity.
