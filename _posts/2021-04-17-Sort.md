1. Stable Sorts
    1. merge sort
    2. Timsort

2. Python Sort
    1. `sorted` or `list.sort()`: Implemented with Timsort, time complexity of `O(nlogn)`, space complexity is `O(n)`.
        * TimSort is a hybrid of MergeSort and InsertionSort
        * In the best case, which occurs when the input is already sorted, it runs in linear time, meaning that it is an adaptive sorting algorithm.
        * It is advantageous over Quicksort for sorting object references or pointers because these require expensive memory indirection to access data and perform comparisons and Quicksort's cache coherence benefits are greatly reduced
        * Timsort is stable
    2. `Timsort`
        * Timsort can require a temp [array containing as many as N//2 pointers][Python Timsort Space Requirements], which means as many as `2*N` extra bytes on `32-bit` boxes.

3. Count Sort


4. `O(logn)` search and insert on sorted data
    1. A sorted list has `O(logn)` search and `O(n)` insert complexity
    2. A priority queue (heap) has `O(n)` in search and `O(1)` in insert.
    2. Balanced Binary Search Tree can give us `O(logn)` time search, delete and insertion. However, if the tree is not balanced, the worst case is `O(n)` to search and `O(1)` to insert.

5. It would be faster to sort a series of subgroups than sorting them all together in a single group
  1. Suppose that we have a list of `N` elements, it would then take `O(NlogN)` time to sort this list.
  2. Next, we divide the list into `k` sublists equally. Each list would contain `N/k` elements. Similarly, it would take `\mathcal{O}(\frac{N}{k} \log \frac{N}{k})` time to sort each sublist.
  3. In total, to sort all the `k` sublists, it would take `\mathcal{O}(k\frac{N}{k} \log \frac{N}{k})=\mathcal{O}(N \log \frac{N}{k})`, which is less than the time complexity of sorting the original list


6. Merge Sort
  1. [归并排序的过程可以在逻辑上抽象成一棵二叉树][归并排序详解及应用]，树上的每个节点的值可以认为是 `nums[lo..hi]`，叶子节点的值就是数组中的单个元素. 然后，在每个节点的后序位置（左右子节点已经被排好序）的时候执行 merge 函数，合并两个子节点上的子数组. 
  2. [我们在使用 merge 函数合并两个有序数组的时候][LC315. Count of Smaller Numbers After Self]，其实是可以知道一个元素 nums[i] 后边有多少个元素比 nums[i] 小的. 换句话说，在对 nuns[lo..hi] 合并的过程中，每当执行 nums[p] = temp[i] 时，就可以确定 temp[i] 这个元素后面比它小的元素个数为 j - mid - 1 而且在它的右边。
