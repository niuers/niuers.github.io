1. Find a cycle in a graph:
    1. Use rank (LC1192)
    2. 

2. Facts:
    1. A critical connection is a connection that, if removed, will make some node unable to reach some other node in a graph.
    2. An edge is a critical connection, if and only if it is not in a cycle.

3. Stable Sorts
    1. merge sort
    2. Timsort

4. Python Sort
    1. `sorted`: Implemented with Timsort, time complexity of `O(nlogn)`.
        * In the best case, which occurs when the input is already sorted, it runs in linear time, meaning that it is an adaptive sorting algorithm.
        * It is advantageous over Quicksort for sorting object references or pointers because these require expensive memory indirection to access data and perform comparisons and Quicksort's cache coherence benefits are greatly reduced
        * Timsort is stable
    2. `Timsort`
        * Timsort can require a temp [array containing as many as N//2 pointers][Python Timsort Space Requirements], which means as many as 2*N extra bytes on 32-bit boxes.

5. Count Sort


4. `O(logn)` search and insert on sorted data
    1. A sorted list has `O(logn)` search and `O(n)` insert complexity
    2. A priority queue (heap) has `O(n)` in search and `O(1)` in insert.
    2. Balanced Binary Search Tree can give us `O(logn)` time search and insertion. However, if the tree is not balanced, the worst case is `O(n)` to search and `O(1)` to insert.
