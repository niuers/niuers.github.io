1. Stable Sorts
    1. merge sort
    2. Timsort

2. Python Sort
    1. `sorted` or `list.sort()`: Implemented with Timsort, time complexity of `O(nlogn)`, space complexity is `O(n)`.
        * TimSort is a hybrid of MergeSort and InsertionSort
        * In the best case, which occurs when the input is already sorted, it runs in linear time, meaning that it is an adaptive sorting algorithm.
        * It is advantageous over Quicksort for sorting object references or pointers because these require expensive memory indirection to access data and perform comparisons and Quicksort's cache coherence benefits are greatly reduced
        * Timsort is stable
    2. `Timsort`
        * Timsort can require a temp [array containing as many as N//2 pointers][Python Timsort Space Requirements], which means as many as `2*N` extra bytes on `32-bit` boxes.

3. Count Sort


4. `O(logn)` search and insert on sorted data
    1. A sorted list has `O(logn)` search and `O(n)` insert complexity
    2. A priority queue (heap) has `O(n)` in search and `O(1)` in insert.
    2. Balanced Binary Search Tree can give us `O(logn)` time search, delete and insertion. However, if the tree is not balanced, the worst case is `O(n)` to search and `O(1)` to insert.

5. It would be faster to sort a series of subgroups than sorting them all together in a single group
  1. Suppose that we have a list of `N` elements, it would then take `O(NlogN)` time to sort this list.
  2. Next, we divide the list into `k` sublists equally. Each list would contain `N/k` elements. Similarly, it would take `\mathcal{O}(\frac{N}{k} \log \frac{N}{k})` time to sort each sublist.
  3. In total, to sort all the `k` sublists, it would take `\mathcal{O}(k\frac{N}{k} \log \frac{N}{k})=\mathcal{O}(N \log \frac{N}{k})`, which is less than the time complexity of sorting the original list
