1. Find a cycle in a graph:
    1. Use rank (LC1192)
    2. 

2. Facts:
    1. A critical connection is a connection that, if removed, will make some node unable to reach some other node in a graph.
    2. An edge is a critical connection, if and only if it is not in a cycle.

3. Stable Sorts
    1. merge sort
    2. Timsort

4. Python Sort
    1. `sorted`: Implemented with Timsort, time complexity of `O(nlogn)`.
        * In the best case, which occurs when the input is already sorted, it runs in linear time, meaning that it is an adaptive sorting algorithm.
        * It is advantageous over Quicksort for sorting object references or pointers because these require expensive memory indirection to access data and perform comparisons and Quicksort's cache coherence benefits are greatly reduced
        * Timsort is stable
3. Different solutions


4. Mistakes

5. Problem Type
    
6. Similar Problems

7. Template

8. I understand the solution, but HOW do I think to GET there myself?
    1. Where could you improve?
    2. What questions should I ask myself so that I push myself closer to the solution? 
    3. What conclusions did I reach that I dropped some idea for the other?
    4. How can I reach this conclusion faster ?
