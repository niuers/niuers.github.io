1. Experience:
    1. This is the second time I work on this problem. The first time, I tried brutal force with `O(n^2)` time complexity, which couldn't pass the test case.
    2. I took a look at other people's solutions and see that they are using merge sort. I probably can never come up with such a solution.
    3. This time, I didn't think about merge sort before, but it happened to me suddenly, probably because I saw the solution before, so I tried to implement the merge sort solution.

2. How did I or Other people get the solution?
