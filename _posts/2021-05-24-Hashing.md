1. Hash generation in constant time
    1. Rabin-Karp algorithm is used to perform a multiple pattern search in a linear time and with a moderate memory consumption suitable for the large strings.
    2. Rolling Hash

2. Generate a hash from an array
```
# visited is an array with values of 0 and 1
def createKey(visited) {
    int key = 0;
    for i, v in enumerate(visited):
        if (!v):   
            key |= 1 << i  #set i-th bit to 1
    }
    return key
}

```

    * You can also start with an integer, and change its value during loop of `visited` using bit operations to get the key.
3. General Hash Methods
    1. MD5: The MD5 message-digest algorithm is a widely used hash function producing a 128-bit hash value.
    2. SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2):  is a set of cryptographic hash functions. The SHA-2 family consists of six hash functions with digests (hash values) that are 224, 256, 384 or 512 bits: SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224, SHA-512/256.
