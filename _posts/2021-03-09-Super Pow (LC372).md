1. Experience:
    1. This is a problem to compute a potentially huge power of a large integer and take module of 1337. Although Python has unlimited integer precision, I think it's asking us to consider on integer with 32-bit. 
    2. I noticed that when two numbers `mod` 1337, their product `mod` 1337 will be the same as the product of each number `mod` 1337.
    3. I tried to utilize above observation and think about binary algorithm. 
    4. However, it's not easy to do a `half` operation on the power as it's represented in list form. It's much  easier to reduce the power by `10` each time, so I can just move through the list each time. 
    5. That's what I did, move backwards through the list of power, each time calculate the `mod 1337` of current number's power of 10.
    6. Note here though, that current number can be as large as 1336, if we do power of 10, that'll be no problem in Python, but it deviates the intention to restrict the number to `2^31`. So when I computed the power of 10, I used another recusrive call to make it as small as power of 2, which is guaranteed to be within the limit.

2. How did I or Other people get the solution? 


3. Different solutions
    1. We can also move forward instead of backwards, which is much simpler.
