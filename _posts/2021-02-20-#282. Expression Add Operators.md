1. Experience:
    1. It seems to me that there's no easy way to solve the problem. So I wrote out the brutal force soltuion, basically check all possible ways to construct a valid expression.
    2. The difficult part is how to save the valid expressions into the final list, and keep track of current partial string.
    3. My initial solution actually got accepted, what a surprise!
    4. After reading the solution, I realized that I don't have to use `eval` to compute the expression value in `O(n)` time, instead, I can do it in `O(1)` if I save the previous operand for `*`. 
    5. Also, I don't have to go through all the prefixes given a string, I only need to check for prefix with size 2, and recursively call the function again to handle other cases where prefix can be longer than 2. However, the implementation might be tricky as the starting string can be empty or with a number.
